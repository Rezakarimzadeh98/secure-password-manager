## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rezakarimzadeh98/secure-password-manager.git
cd secure-password-manager
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Technical Specifications

### Password Generation

The core algorithm uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` to generate cryptographically secure random bytes:

```typescript
const array = new Uint32Array(length);
crypto.getRandomValues(array);
```

This ensures:

- True randomness suitable for cryptographic applications
- Compliance with FIPS 140-2 standards
- Sufficient entropy for password security


### Entropy Calculation

Shannon entropy is computed using:

```text
H = -Σ(p(x) * log2(p(x)))
```

Where `p(x)` represents the probability distribution of characters in the selected charset.

### Character Sets

- Uppercase: A-Z (26 characters)
- Lowercase: a-z (26 characters)
- Numeric: 0-9 (10 characters)
- Symbolic: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>? (25 characters)

Maximum entropy: log2(87^64) ≈ 413 bits

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

- No network requests during generation
- No persistent storage mechanisms
- No logging or analytics tracking
- Client-side only execution model

### Best Practices

- Minimum length: 12 characters recommended
- Include multiple character types
- Avoid dictionary words or patterns
- Use unique passwords per service
